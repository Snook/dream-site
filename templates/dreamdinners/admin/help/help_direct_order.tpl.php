		<p><span class='Readme_header'>How discounts apply to &quot;Misc Non-Food&quot; prices? </span> <br/>
		<span style="color: #FF0000;font-weight: bold;">UPDATED JULY 15th, 2008</span>  - NO DISCOUNTS will apply to the total price charged for &quot;Misc Non-Food&quot;. This was changed due to the complexity of of the separate food and non-food subtotals and tax rates. If you need to discount the Non-Food items, simply adjust the price directly in the price field and add &quot;Administrative Notes&quot; notes in the order if necessary. </p>
