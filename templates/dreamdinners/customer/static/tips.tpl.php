					<p>Are you ready to enjoy your first Dream Dinners meals?<br />To get started, <strong>place two of your meals in the fridge</strong> to thaw for the next few nights.</p>
					<p><strong>For tonight's dinner</strong>, choose one of the "cook from frozen" meal options and prepare according to the instructions, or follow the USDA's cold water thawing method with a bagged meal:</p>
					<p>The bag should be submerged in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw. The meal should thaw in an hour or less. To speed things up, separate the bags of sauce and meat and place them directly in the cold water. Once thawed, cook the meal immediately.<br/><br/></p>
