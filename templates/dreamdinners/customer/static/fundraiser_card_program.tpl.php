						<p>Coupon codes from the Fundraiser Card may be redeemed in any order that the guest desires. Fundraiser card purchasers are not obligated to redeem any of the rewards on their card. 100% of the proceeds from purchasing the fundraiser card will go to the organization that sold the cards. </p>
						<p class="font-italic">Only one coupon code may be applied per Dream Dinners order and coupon code values may not be distributed between multiple orders. Fundraiser cards are non-transferrable and the coupon codes on them may not be shared with other accounts. Fundraiser card holders must show their card at their session to validate offer and have it marked off their card. Fundraiser card offers may not be combined with other loyalty programs, discounts, or promotions. Any guest account that is assigned preferred user status cannot participate in the fundraiser card program without putting their preferred status on hold. No cash surrender value; cannot be replaced if lost or stolen. Dream Dinners, Inc. and its franchisees do not assume any responsibility or liability for damage, expense, or inconvenience, or for any cause whatsoever, due to cancellation or inability to redeem these offers. Altered or duplicated fundraiser cards will not be honored.</p>
