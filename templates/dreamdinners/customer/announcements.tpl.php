					<!--<p>At Dream Dinners, the safety of our guests, our staff and their families are our top priority. Dream Dinners is zoned as a specialty food store meaning we are an essential business and will continue to provide delicious dinners to our guests.</p>
					<p>Our stores are open for curbside pickup, and at participating locations, home delivery. As local jurisdictions allow, we will also be opening assembly sessions on a store by store basis. We pride ourselves on providing a clean environment for our Made for You pick up sessions and assembly sessions where these are possible. With the concerns around COVID-19 across the US, we want to keep you updated on our ongoing health practices.</p>
					<p>At Dream Dinners, we always follow local health guidelines in our professional kitchens including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Our stores are required to be ServSafe and Health Department Certified.</li>
						<li>Every staff member is required to have up to date food handler's cards based on local jurisdiction.</li>
						<li>Staff members are not allowed to come to work if they are sick.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>As local jurisdictions allow us to reopen assembly sessions, we will continue with the following guest guidelines:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Gloves are mandatory. Guests are required to wash their hands and change gloves between every meal they assemble.</li>
						<li>Our counters are sanitized after every guest.</li>
						<li>All additional equipment (including aprons and dishes) are sanitized after every use.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><span class="font-weight-bold">According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there is no evidence to support the spread of COVID-19 through food or food packaging. See the CDC statement here: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html.</a></span> With the spread of COVID-19, we are requiring our stores provide additional food safety training to all staff and are requiring additional hand washing and glove usage for all guests and staff. </p>
					<p>We know that Dream Dinners is your dinnertime solution to help gather your family around the table in this time of uncertainty. We want to support your need to be prepared and avoid the grocery store, instead having easy dinners and side solutions ready in your freezer.</p>-->
