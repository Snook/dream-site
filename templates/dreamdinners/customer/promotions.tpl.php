We help make their life a little less crazy and their summertime a little easier with our ready-to-cook freezer meals, and we want to help you too.</p>
						<p>We are giving away a $200 Lamb & Co gift card to help you get stocked up with all your summertime kitchen needs. You will be automatically entered when you place a new June Dream Dinners order starting today through July 2nd*. This could be your first order for June or an additional second or even third order with an extra meal or a few sides.</p>
						<p class="font-italic">*Orders placed for the June menu before June 20th do not qualify. New orders placed and completed between June 20th and July 2nd are eligible to be entered into the contest.</p>
