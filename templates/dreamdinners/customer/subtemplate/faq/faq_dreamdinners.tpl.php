				<p>Dream Dinners is an innovative concept in meal preparation that eliminates stress by taking away that nagging question of - what am I going to make for dinner tonight? It removes all menu planning, shopping, prep-work and clean-up by moving the meal prep process into specially equipped stores.</p>
				<p>Dream Dinners' guests preview a changing monthly menu online at dreamdinners.com and select their dinners from a menu featuring up to 17 items (depending on location) such as Steak Gorgonzola, Penne with Chicken and Peanut Sauce and Firehouse Three Cheese Pasta with Meatballs. Guest's can choose at least 12 medium dinners or six large dinners (or a combination of both).</p>
				<p>Guests bring boxes or coolers with them to the Dream Dinners store, where our friendly and knowledgeable staff greet them.</p>
				<p>Guests take the uncooked dinners home and freeze them. Each week, three meals are taken from the freezer and placed in the refrigerator to be enjoyed during the upcoming week. </p>
				<p>Our guests find that Dream Dinners enables them to provide their families with home-cooked dinners with less stress and more time to enjoy their families.</p>
				<p>We hope you will give Dream Dinners a try!</p>

				One of our goals at Dream Dinners is to make our visits family-friendly; therefore some of our stores do allow guests to bring their spouse with them to a in-store assembly visit or they may offer special "Date Nights" or "Helper Sessions". Due to the size limitation of our stores, overcrowding of visits can become a concern. In order to provide all of our guests with comfortable visit, and to remain in compliance with local occupancy requirements, Dream Dinners must limit the number of guests in stores at one time. Contact your local store in advance for more information.

By visiting your My Meals page in your account, you can give your dinners up to 5 stars and leave us notes about specific things you liked a lot or would like to see changed.</p>
				<p>New menu items are especially important to rate, because they are starting from scratch. If you want to see them on the menu again, login to your account and let us know how your family liked the dinners. Items you mark "Would order again" are flagged on the menu as a favorite with a star icon to make it easy to remember which menu items you loved.</p>
				<p>The comments you leave about each dinner are read through periodically and can be used to make updates. We do not directly respond to comments. If you have a question or concern about a menu item, please contact your store directly. Please continue to rate and comment on your meals. They are a key piece in our menu selection process!
