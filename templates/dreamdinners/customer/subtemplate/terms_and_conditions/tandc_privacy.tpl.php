				<p>This site is owned and operated by Dream Dinners&reg;. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Dream Dinners&reg;, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
				<p>Dream Dinners&reg; gathers two types of information about users:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to receive periodic promotions, to email a friend, to receive information <em>from our trusted partners</em> and from participation in contests, sweepstakes, polls and surveys.</li>
					<li>Information Dream Dinners&reg; gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to customers' needs and better understand the demographics of our customers. Under no circumstances does Dream Dinners&reg; divulge any information about an individual user to a third party, unless a user has opted in to allow sharing of information.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Dream Dinners&reg; Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
				<dl class="row">
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Electronic newsletters policy and email promotions</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">We offer a free electronic newsletter and periodic email promotions to users. Dream Dinners&reg; gathers the email addresses of users who are registered on our site. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter or email promotion that points users either to the subscription management page or the unsubscribe link.</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">&quot;E-mail this to a friend&quot; policy</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, or documents to someone else by clicking &quot;e-mail this to a friend&quot;. The user must provide their email address, as well as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">Dream Dinners&reg; may occasionally conduct contests and sweepstakes in conjunction with its trusted partners for an opportunity for users to win prizes. The user must provide their email address and other contact information as needed for the particular contest or sweepstakes. This information is used in accordance with the rules applicable to such sweepstakes, contest or promotion. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, and promotion in which you participate through the Site, as they may contain additional important information about Dream Dinners'&reg; or a sponsor's use of your Personal Information.</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Polling</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Dream Dinners&reg; may use a system to &quot;tag&quot; users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</dd>
					<dt class="col-sm-3">Surveys</dt>
					<dd class="col-sm-9">Dream Dinners&reg; may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. We never share any personally identifiable information gathered as part of these surveys.</dd>
