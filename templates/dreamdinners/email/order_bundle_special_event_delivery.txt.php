Thank you for placing a Home Delivery order with Dream Dinners. We look forward to prepping delicious meals for your family.

---------------------------------------------------

*Delivery fees are non-refundable once charged to your order. If the driver arrives and no one is available to accept the delivery, the driver will leave your order at your front door and take a photo before they leave. If the driver cannot leave your order for any reason, they may have to return your order back to the store. This will incur an additional return delivery fee and a possible restocking fee for your order.
