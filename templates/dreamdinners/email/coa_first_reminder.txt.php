Dear Dream Dinners Owner,

You are receiving this email reminder because the deadline for entering your <?php echo $this->prevMonth;?> P&L financial data 
into the input template on BackOffice was <?php echo $this->curMonth;?> 20th.  As of today, we show you have not yet entered
all of your information.   Please use a copy of your Profit & Loss Statement (P&L) to enter this required 
data into the template, ensuring that every line item in the template has been populated.  Enter a �0� (zero) 
in any field if your P&L statement shows zero for that line item.  Please also ensure your P&L financial information 
for all previous months has been input into the template as well.  To avoid further escalation, your 
data needs to be entered no later than <?php echo $this->curMonth;?> 30th.

A guide with step-by-step instructions can be found at
