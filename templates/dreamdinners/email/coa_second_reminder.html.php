<td><p>Dear <?php echo $this->owners?>,</p>
<p>We are deeply concerned regarding your delinquent Profit and Loss (P&L) information that is due by the
20th day of each month, for the previous month&rsquo;s performance.  As of today, your store&rsquo;s data has not
yet been input into the P&L Financial Summary Input Template on BackOffice. We hope this is merely an oversight. Please also refer to your Franchise Agreement, Section 16, where it states the requirement
to submit financial information to Dream Dinners Home Office.</p>

<p>You are a valued member of the Dream Dinners franchise community. Please ensure you to submit your information for the most recent month
 (along with any previous months that have not yet been input) within 10 days of receiving this notice, or we will be forced to take legal action
  and issue a formal Notice of Default.  Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br />
Tina Kuna</p>
