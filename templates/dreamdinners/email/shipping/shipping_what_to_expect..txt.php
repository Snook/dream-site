What to Expect

Your Dream Dinners will be delivered soon! We are so excited to help you with ready-to-cook meals that are easy and delicious. Here is what to expect when they arrive.

- You will be emailed a tracking number when they are on their way.

- Once your meals arrive, place your meals in the fridge to enjoy this week. Your meals may arrive partially frozen or thawed but will still be cold to the touch.
  - Looking to save a few of your meals for next week? If they are still partially frozen, you can place them back in the freezer to refreeze them once.

- Dinners still frozen and you want to cook one when they arrive? Use these quick thaw tips. Submerge bag in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 min. Your meal should thaw in an hour or less.
  - To speed things up, separate the bags of sauce and meat and place them directly in the cold water.
  - Once thawed, cook the meal immediately.

- Looking to use the grill or your air fryer. Scan the QR code on the cooking instructions to see alternate cooking methods.

Enjoy your dinners with your family! When you need more meals, place another order at DreamDinners.com.
