			        </ul>
			      </li>
				  <li><strong>Dinners still frozen and you want to cook one when they arrive?</strong> Use these quick thaw tips.
<ul>
	        <li>Submerge bag in cold tap water, changing the water every 30 min. Your meal should thaw in an hour or less.</li>
				      <li>To speed things up, separate the bags of sauce and meat and place them directly in the cold water.				    </li>
				      <li>Once thawed, cook the meal immediately.				    </li>
			        </ul>
			      </li>
				  <li><strong>Looking to use the grill or your air fryer.</strong> Scan the QR code on the cooking instructions to see alternate cooking methods. </li>
