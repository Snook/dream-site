Some notes on sorting strategy:

Rule #1, Menu Item order in menus is determined by the Food department.  They provide an explicit sorting number. If the sorting number is missing then the order in the handoff is used.

Rule #2, Sizes of an item are order smaller to larger, left to right, top to bottom.

Locations:

*   Menu Editor:   The order is based on 'menu_order_value' (this is stored in menu_to_menu_item and comes from food in the handoff).  The sub-ordering of sizes is enforced by a sort algorithm according to rule #2.
*   Order Manager: Same as menu editor.
*   Printing Labels based on orders:  TBD
*   Core Customer Menu:  Same as Menu Editor
*   Addon Customer Menu:   Same as Menu Editor
*   Item detail page:  Currently sorting by SIZE enum: This will break under 2//4/6.
*   Customer Itemization:  unknown
*   Store Itemization: currently random or DB order
